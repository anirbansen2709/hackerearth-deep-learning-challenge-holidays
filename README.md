HackerEarth Deep Learning Challenge: 'Tis STILL the season to be jolly

An e-commerce platform is getting all geared up for a season clearance sale and plans to leverage social media as the primary channel to reach their audiences. The campaignâ€™s target group are individuals/families that have recently posted a picture of their indoor Christmas decor or are traveling during the holidays. 

You work at a leading social media platform and your team has been tasked to build a product recommendation engine for consumers. As part of the development team, your role is to use Deep Learning to develop a model that classifies images based on elements within the picture. These elements should be related to decor or holiday season vacations, such as a snowman, a Christmas tree, flights, and the like. 

Dataset

The dataset consists of over 6000 images.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge encourages you to apply your Deep Learning skills to build a model that classifies an image based on holiday-related elements.
This challenge will help you to enhance your knowledge of multi-label classification, which is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.
We challenge you to develop a model that successfully identifies holiday-related elements in images and classifies them accordingly.
